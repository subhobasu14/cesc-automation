# ML Pipeline with Airflow & MLflow

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Since some of the CSV's in the `input` folder are large files, for the time being all CSV's in that folder are Git-Ignored. So please copy those from your local to the `input` folder.
3. Make sure Docker Desktop is up.
4. Run `docker-compose up --build`
5. Access Airflow at http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin) - Note Airflow takes some time to up and run.
6. Access MLflow at http://localhost:5000
